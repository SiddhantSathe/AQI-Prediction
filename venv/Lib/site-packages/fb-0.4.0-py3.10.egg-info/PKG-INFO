**************************************************************
*Python Sdk for the Facebook Graph Api*
**************************************************************

| **fb** is a python sdk for the Facebook Graph Api. The sdk provides three methods 
| for interacting largely with facebook. publish(), get_object() and delete()
| 
| **sudo pip install fb**
|


*1. Publishing to Facebook*
===========================
| For publishing, use the publish() method.  Publishing means creating objects like:
| a wall post, a like, events and albums, etc. Currently photo upload
| is not supported. The method returns the id of the object created.
| At `developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/ <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/>`_
| under **'Other  Objects'**, see list of publish categories except "photos".

====================================
 *Examples*
====================================
|    import fb    
|    # Go to `developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer <http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer>`_ to generate test token
|    token="*the facebook token you are going to use*"
|    facebook=fb.graph.api(token)
|    
|    *#Post on the current user's wall*
|    facebook.publish(cat="feed", id="me", message="My facebook status")
|     
|    *#Like an object(wall post, photo and anything thats likable in facebook) with id=object_id*
|    facebook.publish(cat="likes", id=object_id)
|
|    *#Comment on an objects thats commentable*
|    facebook.publish(cat="comments", id=object_id, message="My comment")
|
|    *#Create an album*
|    facebook.publish(cat="albums", id="me", name="Album Name", message="Album Details")
|
|    *Create an event*
|    facebook.publish(cat="events", id="me", name="My Event", start_time="2013-10-16-12:20", end_time="2013-10-18-14:30" )

*Important*
-----------
|    In addition to 'cat' (the category)  and 'id', publish takes any parameter thats
|    valid for the publish category(cat). Like "message" for wall post, "name" for albums, 
|    nothing for likes, etc. Check facebook doc for full list of valid parameters 
|    for each kind of publishing. If you find that a parameter is raising error, 
|    it maybe because this sdk does not yet support the parameter,please report such cases 
|    to the author.

*2. Fetch Objects from Facebook*
================================

| Objects can be fetched in two ways using the get_object() method. 
| Fetch "single" object with  it's given "fields"  passed in a list.
| Or retrieve "multiple" objects passed with their "ids" in a list.
| The method returns the object as python dictionary containing related fields

=============================================
*Examples*
=============================================
|    *#Retrieve given fields for a single object*
|    object=facebook.get_object(cat="single", id=object_id, fields=["name", "email" ] )
|
|    *#Retrieve ALL fields for a single object*
|    object=facebook.get_object(cat="single", id=object_id, fields=[ ] )
|
|    *#Rertieve multiple objects*
|    object=facebook.get_object(cat="multiple", ids=['zuck', 'me'] )

*3. Delete Objects*
===================

| Deleting objects is simple. use the delete method and pass the id of the
| object to be deleted. Note that a "like" has no id in facebook, so in case of deleting 
| a "LIKE", you have to pass the id of the object liked and the category of the delete 
| which is "likes".

=============================================
*Examples*
=============================================
| *#Delete a status*
| facebook.delete(id=status_id)
|
| *#Delete a comment*
| facebook.delete(id=comment_id)
|
| *#Delete a "LIKE"*
| facebook.delete(cat="likes", id=object_id)
|
|

*Introducing The Helper Methods*
================================

| As of version 0.4.0, there is one helper method, *show_fields()*. Using this method,
| it is possible to view the structure of the objects returned by facebook. This will help
| further manipulate the fetched objects for individual needs.

=============================================
*Examples*
=============================================
| *#Get "friends" and "education" of the current user*
| friends_and_education=facebook.get_object(cat='single', id='me', fields=['friends', 'education'])
| *#Display the Structure of the object returned from facebook graph*
| facebook.show_fields(friends_and_education) 
|
| The method will print the following:
| ______________________
| education(list)
|         school
|                id
|                name
|         type
|         year
|              id
|              name
| friends
|        paging
|              next
|        data(list)
|           name
|           id
| id
| _______________________

| The above are all dictionary keys with sub-keys. Some of the keys are prefixed by "(list)" 
| which means their values are saved inside a list and should be accessed through indexing.  
| In line with the structure  printed by the  method, we can access various parts of the object 
| fetched from facebook as shown below
|
| # "name" of schools attended
| friends_and_education['education'][0]['school']['name']
| friends_and_education['education'][1]['school']['name'] and so on........
|
| # "type" of the nth school in the object
| friends_and_education['education'][n]['type']
| 
| #"name" of the nth friend in the object 
| friends_and_education['friends']['data'][n]['name']
|
| #"name" and "id" of all friends
| friends_and_education['friends']['data']
|
| **Note:**
| The idea behind introducing the sub_fields() method is to help developers
| get a visual of the internal structure of objects retrieved from facebook graph 
| so that they can write their own methods easily to further meet their needs.
